# Point-Of-Sale-App
Project: Pizza Planet! A Point of sale system for a small scale business such as a pizza restaurant.

Description: This was our final project for our Comp305 Object Oriented Programming course. The requirements for our project were to code in Java, use gradle, implement proper unit testing, and implement OOP principles.

Assignments: Our team had 4 members which we assigned different roles. Kenny Collins- Team Lead and Backend Darien Aranda- Front End Zach Letcher- Front End Anthony Rojas- Backend

As team lead, Kenny helped organize the design process while coordinating the ideas between both groups. Kenny's primary areas of focus was the gradle build/implementation, Database engineering, and Login Verification. He primarily handled Menu.java, LoginSystem.java, EmployeeDBManager, and Employee.java. He also helped on frontend where needed.

Darien built the entire UI from scratch. He learned javaFX to step through and try to match our lofi UI as much as we could in our timeframe. It was a learning process connecting backend and frontend.

Anthony handled the order handling system. He did a great job going through and fleshing out a system that was relatively straight forward for the front end to connect. He primarily handled OrderGenerator, Order, Regular Order, and Restaruant Business.

Zach's role was to connect the front end buttons to the backend logic.

Shortfalls: At the end of the day, we realized the scope project was greater than our initial plans. We didn't account for our finals during this period and the time commitment that would take us away from this project. We were able to achieve many of our goals, such as creating an order, a login verification system, quality tests, and clean code. However, we weren't able to implment all of the backend we had coded up to the front end. None of us had major front end experience starting this project, but Darien stepped up and learned as much as he can trying to implement a dynamic UI for us to use. We never had a chance to implement different types of orders, adding and removing items from menu, and discount.

Hindsight: I think with more time and the knowledge of scenebuilder we could have implmented a more fleshed out UI, but I think for our overall scope. I think we achieved a quality barebones app. If we had another week, we would focused on a more cookie-cutter approach to our front end dynamically creating buttons and scenes to flesh out our UI. Backend would have organized the order functionality. All in all, great work from the team.

Last Note: We forgot to push one of our updated tests before hte end of the night, so it has to be built with the command ./gradlew build -x test. Other than that, it looks great
